MAKE SURE THEY ARE LOADED IN THAT ORDER

NOTES ABOUT EARLY ALPHA TESTING:

A lot of text isn't written yet, which includes dialogue

Some troop spawns might be odd, please inform me of issues related to such

Slaver parties might be too strong and unfun. If so, speak on it

The troops you see are not yet finalised and their stats are not even up to date with current standards

(PH) means placeholder. The troop is there until I can design a more suitable substitute

(SI) means Shattered Imperium, which means the troop is going to be phased out and is only kept for testing purposes

Currently on the lookout for a OnHeroComesOfAge related crash. If this happens, please let me know and I'll note that down

Load order should look like:
